# Aerospace control system as part of training at the Institute of Information and Educational Center "Avionics" MSTU. N.E. Bauman
  This on-board software is designed for mathematical modeling of aerospace control systems for aircraft for various purposes. It allows you to perform the following operations:

- Collect telemetry while flying from an aircraft
- The ability to carry out an autonomous flight of an aircraft
- Calculate moments of force for different parts of the aircraft
- The ability to track the flight path, test the aircraft control system and the integrated stabilization machine
- Get aerodynamic and other coefficients and etc.

The software was finalized by German Yangalin  on the basis of MSTU. N.E. Bauman and INOTS "Avionics" :)
